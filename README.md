- 👋 Hi, I’m @Codingprodigy-tech
- 👀 I’m a software engineer and I'm versed in Java, Js node, Json, py3, php, markdown, C++, C#, CSS, DDOS, Linux, of course Ubuntu, Markdown, and I'm currently learning object oriented design and SwiftUI as well as attempting to see about this git hoodoo. Lol.  I'm interested in new coding, app development, and beta testing. Oh I'm also learning Ruby on Rails and am interested in any ways to shorten my Java line or command line in general. I'm currently working on a project to see if we can create infallible math algorithms that are the least likely to break down over times or end up as we would dub them "software challenged" since the anomaly would appear in machine programming as a sort of Down syndrome but in computer form. I'm using a flurry of a group and a Morse code backbone in which to carry the original binary coding learning self learning self adaptive software as a drivers seat and steering wheel position mechanically to the driver and back so can we have programming learn from scratch how a certain specific user utilizes it and learns grows and adapts to these changes. The only non constant variables are that chemistry has taught us that math CAN indeed be fallible as can the extra 9/10th of a cent parlor trick but the biggest leap is that of the law of probability that in which can happen given enough time and chance will inevitably come to pass. Well what if we could cut that out as an actual KNOWN variable. And that my friends is where I'm at. Come and join me in my work. I'm currently mastering the science of computers with an emphasis on Big Data to put it in half assed yoda speak (can you believe my wife didn't know who Gizmo or what a Mogwai was?! Anyone else and I'll burn your damn god awfully drawn Pokémon poképéople!) So You can reach me here at GitHub.com/codingprodigy-tech. no spamming please. 
I went to Full Sail University and have my bachelors degree in computer science. I first got into computers and coding with my big bro (who went on to bigger and better things in life and I'm proud of him)
But we got our first computer in the 80's. It was a commodore I'm not sure the make or model but we were rarely EVER allowed to touch it and nobody really ever took the dust jacket it came with that fit exactly over the computer 
And keyboard. It's actually kinda cool and wish they still did that for CPUs cuz it protected the hardware from static electricity. Plus it kept it nice n tidy. But our second computer was the one I am embarrassed to even say is the first one I ever
Learned on was a PS/1 back when CPUs accepted real floppy floppy disks 3.5mm diskettes and EVENTUALLY you could access that extra panel you wondered what it was for well it was for CD ROM. I do miss the days of messing around on DOS and making the computer do stupid things. 
It made us feel like little hackers especially when we got our of course black diskette of the anarchist cookbook which we used to black box and card all the time. But most of that information is defunct now. No more making ID's from death certificates. Lol. But I got back into it and now I'm 
Here to try and see about learning git. I'm a huge cotton candy lover. (And YES the blue and pink kinds taste different), I'm also here to learn from others so don't take it personally if I rip off your repository. I may really like it or have a cool use for it. I also would like to meet others to brainstorm, share ideas, and just make friends.
