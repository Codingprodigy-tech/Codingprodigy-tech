- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Codingprodigy-tech
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new coding, app development, and beta testing. 
I'm currently learning SwiftUI, python 3, and Ruby on Rails, as well as new ways to shorten My JavaScript line. You can reach me here at GitHub.com/codingprodigy-tech. no spamming please. 
I'm a self taught coder certified online through the university of Michigan and Stanford university. 
My brother went to NYU for computer science so I just had to follow suit like the old days way back when when DOS prompt was a code thing I may not be able 
To compete with an NYU master's computer science degree but I do what I can. There's a list of 21 all time best sites to learn and hone coding skills on and that's what I use. 
I'm looking to follow any developers who have something worthwhile to teach. Happy to meet you! Feel free to help out. It'd greatly appreciated. I'm OG and this is my page.
